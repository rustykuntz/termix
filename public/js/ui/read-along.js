// message is raw markdown — `**ready**`, `## Plan`, `` `flag` `` — while what xterm holds is the rendered
// form, bold and heading colour with the marks gone.
//
// Recognised by SHAPE, never by the character alone, because most of these characters are ordinary text in a
// terminal. An emphasis run (* _ ~) has to FLANK — a non-space just inside it, no word character just
// outside — and has to find a partner of the same character and length on the same line. `#` counts only as
// an ATX heading: start of the line, then a space. Backticks count only as a matched pair on one line.
// So `**ready**`, `## Plan` and `` `flag` `` are syntax, while `foo_bar`, `a*b`, `2 * 3`, `snake_case_name`
// and `issue#12` are text and stay text — which is what keeps two DIFFERENT strings from reducing to the
