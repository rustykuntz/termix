// GOLDEN ORDERING — the `//` and `@@` dropdowns. The first section was recorded BEFORE typo tolerance;
// the last section is the ranking ladder Or corrected on 09-09.
//
// "No regression" is only provable against a recorded before. Re-running a suite after a change proves that
// nothing THREW; it does not prove that no existing result MOVED, and moving is the entire risk when a new
// group is appended to a ranked, partitioned list.
//
// ⚠️ RECORDED IS NOT SACRED. These lists are evidence of what shipped, not a promise that it was right: the
// 09-09 ladder fix changed ordering none of them happened to pin, and if a future correction contradicts one,
// the correction wins and the line gets rewritten with the reason. What must never happen is a list quietly
// moving underneath someone.
//
// Read the first section as three clauses: every row the literal pass returns is still returned, in the same
// order, and any appended group starts AFTER the last of them. A fuzzy tail satisfies all three by
// construction. Anything that re-ranks does not.
//
// ⚠️ "EXACT" IN THE OLDER COMMENTS MEANS THE LITERAL SUBSTRING PASS, not whole-name equality. Whole-name
// equality is rank 3 of that pass and is only as old as the ladder section at the bottom.
